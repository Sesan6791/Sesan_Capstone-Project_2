# DSA CAPSTONE Project for Palmora Group HR Analysis

# SESAN CAPSTONE PROJECT
The Capstone Project is the final hand-on assignment to test my ability and skillfulness in data analysis as acquired in the DSA training. The project required me to analyse data of two casestudy scenarios base on the information available. The related scenarios are:

(a) Amazon Product Review Analysis and 

(b) Palmora Group HR Analysis

## Tools Used
- Power BI
  - Uploading of Data by Get Data
  - Extract Transform and Loading of Data by transform Data Editor 
  - Add columns: conditional column
  - Removal of columns
  - Undertaking Report view for presentation of visuals
  - Development of data visualization
- Use of 3D paint and
- Use of snipping tools for data analysis presentation  

## A. PALMORA GROUP HR ANALYSIS
I have approached review and analysis of Palmora Group HR data by uploading the data via "Get Data function" to the table view of PBI. Transform and analyse to respond to various request of the company. 

## Analysis Assumptions
  - Employees that did not disclose their genders were assigned generic gender status "Person" for easy analysis. 
  - Employees with no values in the salary cells have been assumed to exited the company, thus remove from the analysis. 
  - Employees without a department were also taken out

## Analysis Output
The outputs are laid down the following lines: 

#### Questions 1 and 2. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments

#### Output Analysis Result

![1-Gender Distribution in Palmora](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17cb30c2-3a4c-4bcc-b030-31c602c677a8)

Total number of employee analysed is 946
  - Female : 441  (46.62%)
  - Male   : 465  (49.15%)
  - Person : 40   (4.23%)
For the most valid data, the ratio of Female : Male is 1 : 1.052.
This shows that Palmora actaully have almost the same ratio of Female to Male in the organization, therefore, it is obviously wrong to tag the company as "Palmoria, The Manufacturing Patriach". 

The company's gender spread in other consideration as department and locations were also carry out to assertain the status as at the point the analysis.

#### Report
The visual presentation showed tha Palmoria has appreciable number of female in all the locations of its operation. 
  ##### - KADUNA
    -  Female : 165 (45.7%)
    -  Male   : 182 (51.25%
    -  Person : 14
   
  ##### -  Abuja
    -  Female : 158 (47.2%)
    -  Male   : 159 (47.5%
    -  Person : 18

##### -  Lagos
    -  Female : 118 (47.2%)
    -  Male   : 124 (49.6%
    -  Person : 8

The gaps between the two genders are very close in Abuja and Lagos with o.3% and 2.4% differences.




#### Question 3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

#### Output Analysis Result

![3-Gender Salary by locations by departments](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b59af270-cc02-4f5a-96f5-5be57acff841)


![3-Gender and Salary Structure](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9cdfafd-d443-49e9-a7b2-9a0294064044)

From the presentation, the overall female salary and male salary are $24.6Million and $26.3Million, thus the salary gap is just $1.7Million.  

This shows that Palmoria actaully have almost the same ratio of salary for Female to Male in the organization.

#### Question 4a. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000. 
    ● Does Palmoria meet this requirement?

#### Output Analysis Result

##### $90,000 Minimum wage 

![4-Number of people below Minimum Pay ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5408c529-9e03-4042-8e30-7e2d9d24d935)

From the visual presentation, the number of people collecting 

  - less than $90,000        : 721
  - More or equal to $90,000 : 225 

So there are so many people (76.2%) underpaid in Palmoria.  

#### Question 4b. Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
